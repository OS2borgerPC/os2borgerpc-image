This code contains a specialized Ubuntu distribution for audience PCs in
public libraries in Denmark.

The BibOS system is a specialized version of Ubuntu which contains one
preinstalled audience user (called "user", full name "Publikum") and one
sudo-enabled user, by convention called "superuser".

The audience user's home directory is always deleted after each logout
to ensure audience user's privacy. A number of other customizations are
performed.

The system is installed using CloneZilla. The procedure is to prepare an
installation on a physical or virtual computer, clone that system's hard
disk with CloneZilla and create a custome CloneZilla CD which is used as
the install CD (or USB, or DVD).

See the documentation in doc/ for more details.

A couple of HOWTOs:


Creating a new BibOS image from scratch
=======================================

    Start installing a vanilla Ubuntu system - Ubuntu 12.04 in the
    present example. Install on a virtual or physical machine

    Select the correct target language for installation - Danish if
    your users want to work in Danish.

    Create the initial user as Superuser - specify BibOS2 as host name.
    This is by convention, the initial user (sudo user) and host name can
    be whatever you want

    Enter a system/superuser password - IMPORTANT: Remember this

    Think about whether to select the option to encrypt the superuser's
    $HOME directory (current recommendation: Do NOT do this)

    Let the installation run its course - this may take some time

    Reboot the computer when prompted and log in with the user name and
    password you specified

    In a terminal,

    sudo apt-get install git

    # Grab the source code:

    git clone https://github.com/magenta-aps/bibos_image.git

    # Go to the scripts folder:

    cd bibos/image/scripts

    # Create standard BibOS setup:

    ./bibos_setup.sh

    # Wait - this will update, upgrade and install a lot of packages

    # Reboot to complete installation process

    Perform necessary manual configuration - prepare the installation
    so everything is ready the way our customer wants

    When done, go to the scripts folder and finalize the image:

    cd bibos/image/scripts
    ./finalize.sh


    This will force the postinstall script to execute automatically
    next time the system is booted.

After executing finalize, the system is ready for cloning and inclusion
in a CloneZilla image.

Boot up the system with a CloneZilla live CD and clone an image, e.g.
to your own /home/partimag using SSHFS.


HOWTO Build BibOS CD from a CloneZilla image


You need to install these Debian packages:

* squashfs-tools
* aufs-tools
* e2fslibs-dev
* genisomage

This will not work on top of an eCryptFS system (i.e., don't work in
your encrypted Ubuntu home dir).

# Check out the code
git clone https://github.com/magenta-aps/bibos_image.git

# Go to the images directory
cd bibos_image/image/build/images/

# Download clonezilla
wget 'http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/clonezilla/clonezilla_live_alternative/OldFiles/20130314-quantal/clonezilla-live-20130314-quantal-i386.iso'

# Mount this ISO as a file system
cd ..
sudo ./mount_clonezilla.sh images/clonezilla-live-20130314-quantal-i386.iso

# Copy overwrite files to the image (the exact path is output by the
# mount_clonezilla script)
sudo ../scripts/do_overwrite_clonezilla.sh bibos-clonezilla.asIlGOYXbC/cd-unified

# Copy a BibOS hard disk image to the CloneZilla CD
sudo cp -r /sti/til/bibos/image/* bibos-clonezilla.asIlGOYXbC/cd-unified/bibos-image

# Build a new ISO
sudo ./build_clonezilla_image.sh bibos-clonezilla.asIlGOYXbC/

The generated image is a new BibOS CD which will install the hard disk
image you copied. The changes to clonezilla are independent of
architecture and should work for 32 bit and 64 bit CloneZilla and Ubuntu
alike.
