OS2borgerPC: Image
==================

This code contains a specialized Ubuntu distribution for audience PCs in
public libraries in Denmark.

The OS2borgerPC system is a specialized version of Ubuntu which contains one
preinstalled audience user (called "user", full name "Borger") and one
sudo-enabled user, by convention called "superuser".

The audience user's home directory is always deleted after each logout
to ensure audience user's privacy. A number of other customizations are
performed.

The system was prepared by Magenta Aps (https://www.magenta.dk) and is part of the
OS2borgerPC project.
